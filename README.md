# IntelliLend - AI-Powered DeFi Lending Platform on IOTA

## Project Overview
IntelliLend is an intelligent lending protocol that leverages IOTA's unique architecture and AI to revolutionize DeFi lending. It uses machine learning to assess borrower risk, optimize interest rates, and enhance the security and efficiency of lending operations.

## Project Components

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
- Lending pools on IOTA EVM using Solidity
- Collateral management, loan issuance, and liquidation mechanisms
- Secure asset representation on Layer 1 using Move's object-centric model
- Cross-layer communication for enhanced security and efficiency

### AI Risk Assessment Engine
- Machine learning model to assess borrower risk based on on-chain activity
- Transaction pattern analysis, wallet history, and repayment behavior
- Dynamic interest rate model that adjusts based on risk scores
- Early warning systems for potential defaults

### Privacy-Preserving Identity Integration
- IOTA's identity framework for secure user verification
- Privacy-preserving credit scoring
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sharing necessary data without compromising privacy

### Cross-Chain Liquidity Module
- IOTA's cross-chain capabilities for liquidity aggregation
- AI to optimize capital efficiency across different pools and platforms
- Automated strategies for yield optimization

### User Interface
- Intuitive dashboard for borrowers and lenders
- Personalized risk assessments and recommendations
- Visualizations of lending activity and market conditions
- Transparency into how AI influences lending decisions
