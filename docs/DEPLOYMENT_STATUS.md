# IntelliLend Deployment Status

## Deployment Summary

We successfully deployed the IntelliLend project with the following configuration:

### Network Connection
- Connected to IOTA EVM Testnet (Chain ID: 1075)
- RPC URL: https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.iotaledger.net
- Explorer: https://explorer.evm.testnet.iotaledger.net

### Contract Addresses
- LendingPool: `0xbe4be5cf43916`
- CrossLayerBridge: `0x57eba54d25163`

### Mode
- Using mock implementations for development and testing
- Backends properly configured to use mocks when blockchain connection is unavailable

## Backend Services

The following backend services are operational:

### API Server
- Running on: http://localhost:3001
- Endpoints:
  - `/api/user/:address` - Get user lending data
  - `/api/market` - Get market statistics
  - `/api/history/:address` - Get historical data
  - `/api/bridge/messages/:address` - Get bridge messages
  - `/api/recommendations/:address` - Get AI recommendations
  - `/api/risk-assessment` - Update risk score with AI model
  - `/api/deposit` - Deposit funds
  - `/api/borrow` - Borrow funds
  - `/api/bridge/send-message` - Send message to Layer 1

### AI Model
- Risk assessment model trained and saved
- API running on: http://localhost:5000
- Endpoints:
  - `/predict` - Predict risk score for a user
  - `/batch-predict` - Process multiple users
  - `/importance` - Return feature importance

## Getting Testnet Tokens

To deploy to the actual IOTA EVM Testnet (instead of using mocks), you need to:

1. **Fund your wallet with testnet tokens**
   - Visit the IOTA Testnet Faucet: https://faucet.testnet.iotaledger.net
   - Enter your wallet address: `0x3c0d9184692b1E34852d0F0be7adC3bd1Dbf0e15`
   - Wait for the tokens to arrive
   - See TESTNET_FUNDING.md for detailed instructions

2. **Re-run the deployment script**
   - Execute: `node scripts/deploy-iota-testnet.js`
   - This will deploy the actual contracts to the testnet

## Real Deployment Requirements

For a successful deployment to the IOTA EVM Testnet, you need:

1. **Funded Wallet**: Your wallet needs testnet IOTA tokens
2. **RPC Connection**: Connection to https://json-rpc.evm.testnet.iotaledger.net
3. **Contract Compilation**: Properly compiled smart contract bytecode
4. **Proper ABIs**: Complete ABIs for contract interaction

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Development**: Complete and test the frontend application
2. **Full Integration Testing**: Test the entire stack with mock implementations
3. **Production Preparation**:
   - Test thoroughly on testnet before moving to mainnet
   - Fine-tune AI model with real blockchain data
   - Implement comprehensive security measures
   - Add monitoring and alerting

## APIs for Production Implementation

For a production-ready implementation, these external APIs would be needed:

1. **IOTA Node API**: For Layer 1 interactions
2. **Oracle APIs**: For price and market data
3. **Identity APIs**: For secure user verification
4. **Analytics APIs**: For transaction pattern analysis
5. **Storage APIs**: For historical data and model storage

## Security Considerations

1. **Private Key Management**: Use secure key management solutions (not .env files)
2. **Contract Audits**: Full security audit of smart contracts
3. **API Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, and encryption
4. **Data Privacy**: Implement privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive user data
