   - Enhanced `Header` with modern search field and action buttons
   - Updated color schemes, transitions, and overall design language

## Implementation Details

### Visualization Components

These components use the Recharts library to create interactive visualizations that help users understand their risk profiles:

- **RiskFactorBreakdownChart**: Bar chart showing each factor's contribution to risk score
- **RiskTimelineChart**: Line chart tracking risk score over time with color-coded risk zones
- **RiskComparisonRadar**: Radar chart comparing current profile to optimal values
- **FactorImpactHeatmap**: Scatter plot visualizing impact vs contribution for risk factors

### Analysis & Simulation Tools

These tools provide interactive interfaces for users to analyze and simulate different scenarios:

- **ScenarioAnalysisTool**: Allows users to simulate changes to risk factors
- **BorrowingStrategySimulator**: Advanced tool for testing borrowing strategies under different market conditions
- **ActionableInsightsPanel**: Provides personalized AI recommendations with clear, actionable steps

### UI Enhancements

The overall UI has been redesigned to be more modern, user-friendly, and consistent with IOTA's design language:

- **Sidebar**: Now features expandable sections, improved navigation, and visual hierarchy
- **Header**: Updated with modern search field, action buttons, and wallet connection interface
- **Overall styling**: Improved color gradients, animations, shadows, and responsive design

## Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Connect the AI components to real data sources in the backend
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures
   - Add loading states and placeholders for asynchronous operations

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**

   - Optimize layouts for smaller screens, especially complex visualizations
   - Implement touch-friendly interactions for mobile users

3. **Backend Implementation**
   - Develop backend APIs to support the new AI features
   - Implement AI model integration for risk assessment
   - Create data processing services for visualization components

4. **Testing & QA**
   - Conduct usability testing for new AI interfaces
   - Test with different data scenarios and edge cases
   - Optimize performance for large datasets

### Additional Enhancement Ideas

1. **AI Features**
   - Add predictive analysis for market trends
   - Implement personalized learning based on user behavior
   - Create AI-guided onboarding flow for new users

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add dark/light theme toggle animations
   - Create micro-interactions for better user feedback
   - Implement guided tours for complex features

3. **IOTA-Specific Features**
   - Enhance Cross-Layer Bridge visualization
   - Improve IOTA wallet connection experience
   - Add IOTA network status monitoring
