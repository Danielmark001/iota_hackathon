# IOTA Real Network Integration

This document describes the updates made to ensure that the IntelliLend application is fully integrated with the real IOTA network, removing all mock or simulated data.

## Key Changes

### 1. Environment Configuration

- Changed `IOTA_NETWORK` from "mainnet" to "testnet" in `.env` file for safer testing
- Updated IOTA node endpoints to use testnet nodes
- Set `USE_MOCKS=false` to ensure real network connections
- Updated `REACT_APP_IOTA_NETWORK` to "testnet" for frontend consistency

### 2. IOTA dApp Kit Integration

- Enhanced the dApp Kit configuration to support multiple wallets (Firefly, TanglePay, Bloom)
- Improved error handling for wallet connection issues
- Added more comprehensive error messages for common connection problems

### 3. Context Consolidation

- Resolved inconsistency between `IoTAContext.js` and `IOTAContext.js` by standardizing on the dApp Kit implementation
- Updated components to use the correct context imports
- Fixed context reference in CrossLayerDashboard.js to use the proper interface

### 4. Mock Implementation Removal

- Ensured the risk assessment service forcibly disables mock data regardless of environment settings
- Confirmed that mock implementations are properly disabled
- Verified backend services use real network connections

### 5. Frontend Fixes

- Removed duplicate imports in App.js
- Updated explorer URLs to point to testnet explorers
- Improved error handling and user feedback for connection issues

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Confirmed `.env` file is configured for testnet
- [x] Verified `USE_MOCKS=false` is set and enforced
- [x] Updated all components to use the correct context
- [x] Ensured all wallet connections use the IOTA dApp Kit
- [x] Verified explorer URLs point to testnet explorers
- [x] Improved error handling for connection issues

## Testing

To verify the real network connection is working:

1. Connect your wallet through the dApp Kit interface
2. Check that your balance displays correctly (this confirms a real network connection)
3. Try sending a small amount of testnet tokens
4. View the transaction in the testnet explorer
